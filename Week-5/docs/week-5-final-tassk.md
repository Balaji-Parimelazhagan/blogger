# 7-Day Debugging Roadmap for `/Week-5` (react-shopping-cart)

## Overview

This roadmap guides you through a systematic debugging and improvement process for the `/Week-5` directory of the `react-shopping-cart` project. It covers state management, performance, error handling, security, code quality, and production readiness, with daily priorities and deliverables.

---

## Day 1: Audit & Prioritize

- **Tasks:**
  - Review `/Week-5/src/contexts`, `/Week-5/src/components`, `/Week-5/src/services`, and `/Week-5/src/utils` for React anti-patterns, state management issues, and performance bottlenecks.
  - Identify critical bugs, broken flows, and high-impact performance issues.
  - Document all findings in a bug tracker or spreadsheet.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Categorized bug/issue list with priorities.
  - Initial report on state management and performance issues.

---

## Day 2: State Management & React Anti-Patterns

- **Tasks:**
  - Refactor all state updates to be immutable (no direct mutation).
  - Audit and improve custom hooks and context providers.
  - Remove unnecessary state duplications and prop drilling.
  - Add/expand unit tests for context and hooks.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Refactored, robust state management code.
  - Passing unit tests for state logic.

---

## Day 3: Performance Optimization

- **Tasks:**
  - Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Optimize product filtering and cart computations.
  - Profile and optimize slow rendering or computation.
  - Add performance tests and measure before/after results.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Optimized components and hooks.
  - Performance test results and metrics.

---

## Day 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **Tasks:**
  - Add robust try-catch and user-friendly error messages to all API calls.
  - Implement retry logic for failed requests.
  - Display loading and error states in the UI.
  - Test for empty states, network failures, and invalid data.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Improved error handling in services and UI.
  - Edge case test coverage.

---

## Day 5: Security Review & Fixes

- **Tasks:**
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
  - Run `npm audit` and fix vulnerabilities.
  - Ensure no secrets or API keys are in the repo.
  - Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Secure input handling and updated dependencies.
  - Security checklist.

---

## Day 6: Code Quality, Maintainability & Testing

- **Tasks:**
  - Run ESLint and Prettier; fix all issues.
  - Ensure all TypeScript types are correct and explicit.
  - Add JSDoc/TSDoc to complex functions and public APIs.
  - Increase unit and integration test coverage.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Clean, well-documented, and type-safe code.
  - High test coverage.

---

## Day 7: Production Readiness & Monitoring

- **Tasks:**
  - Add error logging (e.g., Sentry) and performance monitoring.
  - Test deployment pipeline (CircleCI, Firebase).
  - Update README and create a CHANGELOG.
  - Manual QA and user experience review.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Monitoring and logging in place.
  - Deployment tested and documented.
  - Final project report and handoff.

| 6   | Code Quality & Testing | Lint, docs, type safety, test coverage     |
| 7   | Prod Readiness         | Monitoring, deployment, final docs         |

---

## Testing & Monitoring Strategy

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests.
- Add performance tests for critical paths.
- Manual QA for user flows and edge cases.
- Set up error and performance monitoring.
- Add regression tests for all fixed bugs.
- Document all fixes and prevention strategies.
