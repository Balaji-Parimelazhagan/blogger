# Cart Function: What It Was, Issues, and Changes Made

## What the Function Did

The `addProduct` function was used to add a new product to the shopping cart. If the product was already in the cart, it tried to update the quantity. If not, it added the new product to the list. After that, it updated the cart's total price.

## Issues Found

1. **Possible Hidden Changes:**

   - The function used another helper called `updateQuantitySafely`. If this helper changed the product directly, it could cause problems in how React updates the screen.

2. **Unneeded Updates:**

   - The function always updated the cart, even if the product's quantity did not actually change. This could make the app do extra work for no reason.

3. **Not Always Making New Objects:**
   - When updating a product, it might not always make a new copy of the product. In React, it's important to make new copies so changes are noticed.

## What Was Changed

- The function now checks if the product's quantity is really changing before updating the cart. If nothing changes, it does nothing.
- When updating a product, it always makes a new copy of the product with the new quantity. This helps React see the change and update the screen correctly.
- When adding a new product, it also makes a new copy, just to be safe.

**In short:**

- Only update the cart if something really changed.
- Always make new copies of products and the cart list when changing them.
- This makes the app faster and more reliable.
