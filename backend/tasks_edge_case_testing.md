# Edge Case Testing Task List (AI-Assisted)

## 1. Select Critical Business Logic
- [x] List all core business logic modules (user registration, login, post creation, commenting, tagging, related posts)
- [x] Prioritize modules by business impact and complexity
- [x] For each module, identify the main functions and endpoints

## 2. Use AI to Identify Potential Edge Cases
- [x] For each prioritized module, describe its purpose and expected behavior
- [x] Use AI to generate a list of potential edge cases for each function/endpoint (10+ total)
- [x] Review and refine the AI-generated edge cases for relevance and completeness
- [x] Document all identified edge cases in a shared file (`docs/EDGE_CASES.md`)

## 3. Generate and Implement Tests for Each Edge Case
- [x] For each edge case, write a test case in a new or existing test file
- [x] Implement the test cases using `supertest` for API endpoints and `jest` for model-level logic
- [x] Run tests and ensure they pass; address any failures in the implementation
- [ ] **TODO:** Resolve remaining test failures in `user.test.js` and `userProfile.test.js`

## 4. Implement Robust Error Handling for Discovered Issues
- [x] Add validation and sanitization for all user inputs (`express-validator`, `DOMPurify`)
- [x] Implement proper error handling middleware to catch and respond to unexpected errors
- [x] Ensure all API endpoints return consistent and meaningful error responses

## 5. Document All Edge Case Scenarios
- [x] Create a new file `docs/EDGE_CASES.md` to document the scenarios
- [x] For each edge case, describe the scenario, expected behavior, and implementation details
- [x] Review documentation for clarity and completeness

## Assessment and Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Line coverage:** 68.66% (Target: 85%+)
- [ ] **Branch coverage:** 53.16% (Target: 80%+)
- [ ] **Function coverage:** 71.42% (Target: 90%+)
- [ ] **Test Quality Metrics:**
    - [ ] Test readability score (AI assessment needed)
    - [ ] Test maintainability index (Tooling needed)
    - [ ] Test execution time (Currently high due to test setup/teardown)

### Development Metrics
- [ ] **Bugs caught in testing vs. production:** Several bugs and inconsistencies were caught and fixed during this task.
- [ ] **Developer satisfaction with testing workflow:** (Subjective, but the current state is likely low due to instability).
